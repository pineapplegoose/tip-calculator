# Tip-calculator
#### A simple tip calculator that calculates the tip and bill amount per person, based on the bill amount and the tip percentage given.

The tip calculator accepts the bill amount entered by the user, the user is then expected to select the tip percentage they like to give, they then input the number of people splitting the bill. The app upon input calculates and outputs total amount each person is to pay and per person.
